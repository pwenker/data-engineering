### Purpose of this Project

- This repository contains my notes for [**Udacity's Data Engineering Nanodegree**](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027) :rocket:
- The notes are represented in a *question-and-answer* format to allow for [active recall testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_recall) :brain:
- If you have completed the degree yourself, you might be interested in testing your knowledge by trying to answer the questions. Regardless of your ability to answer the questions, and the
  quality of my written answers :sweat_smile:, the mere exposure and deliberate retrieval practice will help you consolidate your knowledge :exploding_head:
- Have fun!  :partying_face:
